# StepUp

This app is a step counter app. But in addition to counting steps our app will 
take data from users. This data is the amount of calory they have consumed last 
or they can choose meal items generated by our app.

Our app will help users know how many steps they should make to burn the calories
from the meal they added to the list.

Users will be notified when they complete the steps required to burn a certain meal.
